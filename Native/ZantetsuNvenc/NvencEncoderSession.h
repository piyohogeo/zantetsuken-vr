// Phase 0.11 retained NVENC encoder session.
//
// One owner holds everything a session needs to stay usable: the driver module
// and its function table, an independent reference to the exact D3D11 device
// Unity is using, and the encoder handle opened on that device. They are opened
// in that order and closed in the reverse one, so the session never outlives
// what it was opened against.
//
// This is not a probe session that is opened and thrown away. The session
// stays open until it is closed explicitly, so the units that come after can
// query and initialize this very encoder.
//
// Nothing here queries a capability, initializes an encoder, or creates an
// event, texture, or buffer.
